          "**Consumer Electronics:** Semiconductors are the brains of our devices. A smartphone's CPU (Central Processing Unit) and GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), for example, are highly sophisticated chips that manage everything from app performance to high-resolution video playback. Wearable devices and smart home gadgets rely on low-power semiconductors to operate efficiently for extended periods.",
          "**Healthcare and Medicine:** Advanced diagnostic machines like MRIs and CT scanners are powered by powerful processors. Wearable health trackers use tiny chips to monitor vital signs in real-time, while next-generation medical implants and point-of-care diagnostics are enabled by specialized, ultra-compact semiconductors.",
          "**Automotive Industry:** Modern vehicles are mobile computers. Semiconductors are crucial for ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems), engine management, and entertainment systems. The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) has made them even more critical, with chips managing everything from battery charging and power delivery to motor control.",
          "**Industrial Automation and IoT:** In a smart factory, semiconductors are embedded in sensors, robotic arms, and control systems, enabling seamless communication and real-time data analysis. These chips allow for predictive maintenance, where machines can signal when they need servicing before a failure occurs, and autonomous factory operations that dramatically increase efficiency."
